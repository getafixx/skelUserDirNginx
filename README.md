# skelUserDirNginx
The skeleton directory, which contains files and directories to be copied in the user's home directory, when the home directory is created by useradd. This option is only valid if the -m (or --create-home) option is specified.  If this option is not set, the skeleton directory is defined by the SKEL variable in /etc/default/useradd or, by default, /etc/skel.
